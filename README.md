# React_Test_App
The test code for the react app

## About it
 Itâ€™s only a profile page of the app. I just created it very simple as i am very new to React.js. It is bit similar to the requirement asked but it is very normal and simple. Code is very much fine and very much understandable. 
 
## Setup/Run the App 
 Download the file from the github, and directly open the ReactTest_App.html file in the browser
 
## Data Flow 
 I have make the components of the code in may different small components, basically i try to create a code which is very simple and with low complexity. Given is the components of my code:
 The Main Component is called as `DATA` which is having two components called as `PROFILE` and `PAGES`.
 
 PROFILE: contains the name of the profile and the images for the profile.
 
 PAGES: contains the list for the Pages.
 
 IMAGES: When you refresh the browser, the images will change randomly. (The images are taken randomly from http://lorempixel.com/).
 
 MY PAGES: Contains the list of all the pages to be shown.
 
## Structure of the App
 The structure of the app is as follows:
 - App
    - Profile
      - Name
      - Role
      - Place
      - CompanyName
      - Images
    - Pages
     - List of Pages

## Libraries used:
 I have setup the file properly, so will see links to the React source and the other necessary libraries in the <head/> section of the file. 
 - `<script src="https://fb.me/react-0.14.6.js"></script>`
 - `<script src="https://fb.me/react-dom-0.14.6.js"></script>`
 - `<script src="http://fb.me/JSXTransformer-0.12.1.js"></script>`
 
## Technical Challenges i have faced
 As I am very fresh to React.js, as kept myself as a learner i wirte this test, i had to research about the React.js framework and how to use it. Technically challenge in React.js to use HTML5 tags which i have faced.
