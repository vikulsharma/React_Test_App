# React_Test_App
The test code for the react app

## About it
 Itâ€™s only a profile page of the app. I just created it very simple as i am very new to React.js. It is bit similar to the requirement asked but it is very normal and simple. Code is very much fine and very much understandable. 
 When you refresh the browser, the images will change randomly. (The images are taken randomly from http://lorempixel.com/).
 
## Setup/Run the App 
 Download the file from the github, and directly open the ReactTest_App.html file in the browser
 
## Description of the App
 Make components for the app:
 The Main Component is called as `DATA` which is having two components called as `PROFILE` and `PAGES`.
 
 PROFILE: contains the name of the profile and the images for the profile.
 
 PAGES: contains the list for the Pages.
 
 IMAGES: the images will change randomly.
 
 MY PAGES: Contains the list of all the pages to be shown.
 
## Structure of the App
 The structure of the app is as follows:
 - App
    - Profile
      - Name
      - Role
      - Place
      - CompanyName
      - Images
    - Pages
     - List of Pages
